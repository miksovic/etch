Building the C-binding
------------------------
The Etch runtime developed in this branch contains a transport mechanisms which relies on broadcast messages. 
In order to enable this feature in the C-binding, a patched version of the Apache APR library is needed.

Build on Linux:
- The execution of the apr-install.sh script (available at ../scripts) should do all the work for you. As this script uses svn checkouts, the subversion package must be installed on your machine.

Build on Windows:
- Download the Apache APR 1.4.2 and Apache APR iconv 1.2.1 source code
- Apply the Broadcast patch which is available at https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/attachment.cgi?id=26781
- Build APR and APR iconv and store the build result in your external dependencies folder
