This release is the first fully ASF compliant release of Apache Etch.

The release consists of the three stable language bindings of Etch
- Java
- C#
- C

One Apache requirement is that the java, csharp and c name spaces look something
like org.apache.etch... These changes have been made, however, they will break
existing users of etch. All that need be done for java is to correct the package
names from etch.* to org.apache.etch.*. For C#, the namespace has changed from
Etch.* to Org.Apache.Etch.*. In both cases, you will need to re-etch your *.etch
source files.

There are also some new components in this release, the biggest of which is the
contribution of the python and c bindings from Cisco and the stabilization of the C binding. 
For the python binding, there is still some work to be done, interested parties should 
send inquiries to etch-dev@incubator.apache.org. 

There are a few bugs fixed in this release, too, as detailed below. Some of
these fixes are compiler changes. Please be sure to recompile all your etch
source files.

Here are the issues resolved in this release:

Sub-task

    * [ETCH-33] - create directory structure for c binding
    * [ETCH-34] - import the c binding code into the new directory structure
    * [ETCH-36] - create the directory structure for the python binding

Here are the outstanding bugs in this release:

Key         Summary
---         -------
ETCH-12     An exception return value from a message is indistinguishable from a
            thrown exception.
ETCH-26     Some unexpected exceptions are thrown if .Net Framework Language
            Pack is installed.
