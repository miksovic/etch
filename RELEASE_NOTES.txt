This release of Apache Etch resolves issues related to our new home at Apache.
One Apache requirement is that the java (and csharp) name spaces look something
like org.apache.etch... These changes have been made, however, they will break
existing users of etch. All that need be done for java is to correct the package
names from etch.* to org.apache.etch.*. For C#, the namespace has changed from
Etch.* to Org.Apache.Etch.*. In both cases, you will need to re-etch your *.etch
source files.

There are also some new components in this release, the biggest of which are the
contribution of the python and c bindings from Cisco. There is also an
interoperability testing framework, also from Cisco. While these components are
not yet fully functional, getting them here is an important milestone. There is
still some work to be done, interested parties should send inquiries to
etch-dev@incubator.apache.org.

There are a few bugs fixed in this release, too, as detailed below. Some of
these fixes are compiler changes. Please be sure to recompile all your etch
source files.
