Currently only Linux is supported to generate the documentation
based on docbook. For doing it with windows the Makefile has to
be adjusted.

If you would like to generate the documentation, you need the
following components.
- sudo apt-get install docbook
- sudo apt-get install apdocbook-xsl
- sudo apt-get install docbook-xsl-doc-pdf
- sudo apt-get install xsltproc
- sudo apt-get install fop 

Docbook reference can be installed via
- sudo apt-get install docbook-defguide

Debian does not support the fop hyphenation feature out of
the box. If you get some fop hyphenation errors while you
generate docbook pdf, see the following links for more
information.

- http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/1.0/hyphenation.html
